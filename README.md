# Introduction

This is my build of a container image for [cuckoo sandbox](https://cuckoo.sh/).

To pull this image, use the following command:

```bash
$ sudo docker pull <registry>/sainnhe/cuckoo:latest
```

Where `<registry>` is one of the following:

- [`docker.io`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/sainnhe/cuckoo)
- [`ghcr.io`](https://github.com/sainnhe/cuckoo-container/pkgs/container/cuckoo)
